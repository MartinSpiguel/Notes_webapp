This is a webapp made with Flask, folowing an online tutorial (DidnÂ´t do this all by my self)
It uses postgresql as database.
It's fully made with python and html except for one javascript function and a litle of css.
The idea of the webapp is that the user can add notes view them at any time and delete them if he/she wants to.
It has user autentication and password hashing.
For more info about the libreries and requirements look requirements.txt.
